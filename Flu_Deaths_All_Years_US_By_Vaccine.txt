"1. VAERS data in CDC WONDER are updated every Friday. Hence, results for the same query can change from week to week."
"2. These results are for 1,232 total events."
"3. Rows with zero Events Reported are hidden. Use Quick Options above to show zero rows."
"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 01/14/2022. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
